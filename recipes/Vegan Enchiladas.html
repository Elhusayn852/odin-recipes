    <p>
      These vegan enchiladas are seriously delicious. Whenever I make them, my
      husband<br />
      Jack and I fight over the last one. For context, Jack might be the world's
      biggest<br />
      cheese lover. If he's going after cheese-less enchiladas, you know they
      have to be<br />
      good.
    </p>

    <p>
      The filling here is a hearty mixture of mushrooms, peppers, and black
      beans. I roll<br />
      it up in corn tortillas and then smother them with red enchilada sauce and
      homemade<br />
      vegan nacho cheese. Before serving, I sprinkle garnishes like jalapeños,
      radishes,<br />
      and avocado on top.
    </p>

    <p>
      This vegan enchiladas recipe is comforting, but also fresh. The rich
      enchilada<br />
      sauce and vegan cheese create an incredible contrast with the fresh
      veggies. Try it<br />
      the next time you're craving something healthy, filling, and flavorful—it
      won't<br />
      disappoint!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>
      Ready to make vegan enchiladas? You can find the complete recipe at the
      bottom of this post, but for now, I'll give you an overview of how it
      goes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Corn tortillas</h3>
        <p>
          Use 100% corn tortillas if you need this recipe to be gluten-free. If
          not, I<br />
          recommend using tortillas made from a mix of corn and wheat flour.
          They have the<br />
          wonderful flavor of corn tortillas but the pliability of flour
          tortillas, which<br />
          makes them great for rolling.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Red enchilada sauce</h3>
        <p>
          I love my homemade enchilada sauce in this recipe! Get ahead by making
          it a day<br />
          or two in advance. Alternatively, use store-bought vegan enchilada
          sauce to<br />
          streamline this recipe.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Vegan cheese</h3>
        <p>
          This creamy, tangy sauce tastes like cheddar cheese, but it's made
          from whole<br />
          foods, plant-based ingredients like cashews, sweet potatoes, and
          nutritional<br />
          yeast.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Onion and garlic</h3>
        <p>They add savory flavor to the enchilada filling.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Mushrooms, poblano peppers, and black beans</h3>
        <p>They make the filling hearty and satisfying.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Chili powder and cumin</h3>
        <p>They add warm, earthy flavor to the filling mixture.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Extra-virgin olive oil</h3>
        <p>For sautéing the veggies.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Fresh lime juice</h3>
        <p>Squeeze it over the enchiladas for a pop of bright flavor.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Fresh garnishes</h3>
        <p>
          Think cilantro, jalapeños, radishes, avocado, and/or diced red onion.
          They offer<br />
          a refreshing contrast to the comforting enchiladas!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Sea salt</h3>
        <p>To make all the flavors pop!</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        First, make the vegan cheese. The first step in this recipe is making
        the vegan<br />
        cheese. If you like, get ahead by prepping it a day or two in advance.
        Note that<br />
        it will thicken in the fridge. You'll likely need to add water to thin
        it to a<br />
        creamy, drizzleable texture before assembling the enchiladas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, make the mushroom filling. Sauté the onions, peppers, and
        mushrooms until<br />
        soft, seasoning them with the garlic and spices partway through the
        cooking time.<br />
        Stir in the black beans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the enchiladas. Spread 1/2 cup enchilada sauce at the bottom of
        a<br />
        9×13-inch baking dish. Fill each tortilla with a little nacho cheese and
        some of<br />
        the veggie filling. Roll tightly to close and place seam side down in
        the<br />
        prepared pan. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce down the middle of
        the<br />
        enchiladas, leaving the edges of the tortillas exposed. Cover the
        enchiladas and<br />
        bake for 15 minutes at 400°F. Uncover and bake until the bare edges of
        the<br />
        tortillas are lightly crisp, 10 to 20 more minutes. Loosen the cheese
        sauce with<br />
        water as needed to reach a creamy, drizzleable consistency. Pour 1/2 cup
        down the<br />
        center of the enchiladas. Top with fresh garnishes and squeeze with lime
        juice<br />
        before digging in!

      <li>
        How to Store and Freeze Store leftovers in an airtight container in
        the<br />
        refrigerator for up to 4 days. They reheat nicely in the microwave or
        oven! These<br />
        enchiladas also freeze well. After baking, top them with the cheese
        sauce and<br />
        allow them to cool to room temperature. Cover tightly with foil or
        plastic wrap<br />
        and freeze for up to 3 months. Allow the frozen enchiladas to thaw
        overnight in<br />
        the fridge. Reheat them, covered, in a 350°F oven or warm them in the
        microwave.
