    <p>
      This creamy vegan pasta is my favorite recipe to make when I’m c<br />raving
      comfort food but don’t have hours to spend in the kitch<br />en. From
      start to finish, it takes just over 20 minutes to mak<br />e, so it’s the
      perfect weeknight meal. All you need to do is bo<br />il the pasta, blend
      up the sauce, sauté onion and broccoli, and<br />
      toss it all together. Then, you can sit down to devour warm bo<br />wls of
      noodles and veggies coated with this super creamy vegan <br />pasta sauce.
      While this sauce looks like a rich cream or cheese<br />
      sauce, it’s actually a tangy, luscious blend of
      <strong>White beans</strong>, <br /><strong>Lemon Juice</strong>, and
      <strong>nutritional yeast</strong>. So this recipe is not only <br />quick
      & comforting, but it’s also healthy!

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      Of course, this creamy vegan pasta sauce is totally dairy-free<br />but
      it’s also different than many vegan pasta sauces I make.<br />Often, I
      turn to raw cashews or coconut milk in these recipes<br />but this time, I
      went in a different direction. Here’s what I used:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>White beans</h3>
        <p>
          are the secret ingredient that make this sauce thick,<br />
          smooth, and creamy! They also add a good amount of plant-based<br />
          protein. Use canned beans, or cook your own.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Olive oil</h3>
        <p>Adds richness to the sauce, making it smooth and <br />flavorful.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Nutritional yeast</h3>
        <p>Fills this vegan pasta with a yummy, cheese-like <br />flavor.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Onion powder & garlic</h3>
        <p>
          Amp up the savory, umami flavors in this recipe, <br />adding depth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Vegetable broth</h3>
        <p>
          Loosens the sauce as needed. You can also use some <br />pasta cooking
          water.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Pasta</h3>
        <p>
          I used small shell pasta, but use what you have on <br />hand.
          Orecchiette, bow ties, or rigatoni work well. <br />Check the label to
          ensure it's vegan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Broccoli and chopped stems</h3>
        <p>
          A great way to use up the whole vegetable. If your <br />broccoli has
          leaves, toss them in too!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Pine nuts</h3>
        <p>Add a delicious crunch, enhancing both texture and <br />flavor.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Switch the vegetables. Sautéed broccoli and onion are my go-to veggies
        here, but roasted broccoli, roasted cauliflower or Brussels sprouts
        would also be delicious. In the summer, stir in roasted tomatoes. In the
        spring, add market-fresh asparagus.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skip the actual pasta. Instead of regular pasta, serve this sauce over
        spaghetti squash or zucchini noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spice it up. I love adding a few pinches of red pepper flakes to my
        bowl. Pickled jalapeños would be another fun, punchy addition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Get creative with flavor add-ins. Amp up this creamy vegan pasta with
        chopped sun-dried tomatoes, dollops of vegan pesto, or fresh basil
        leaves.
      </li>
    </ol>
