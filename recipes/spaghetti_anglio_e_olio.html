    <p>
      Spaghetti aglio e olio, meaning "spaghetti with garlic and oil," is a
      simple yet<br />
      flavorful Italian dish made with just pasta, olive oil, garlic, salt, and
      pepper.<br />
      Optional additions like parsley or red pepper flakes can be included, but
      they are<br />
      not necessary. The garlic infuses the oil with a rich, nutty flavor, and
      pasta<br />
      cooking water helps create a savory sauce. This dish is quick, taking just
      20<br />
      minutes to prepare, and uses basic pantry ingredients. It's a delicious,
      easy meal<br />
      that's perfect for any night and highly addictive.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>
      Of course, my spaghetti aglio e olio recipe includes a few fresh twists. I
      start with these traditional ingredients:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Spaghetti</h3>
        <p>
          If you don't have spaghetti on hand, use whatever pasta you do have. I
          recommend<br />
          choosing a long pasta like fettuccine, linguine, or bucatini, but if
          short-cut<br />
          pasta is what's in your kitchen, it'll still come out delicious.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Olive oil</h3>
        <p>Use the best one you have.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Garlic</h3>
        <p>
          The star ingredient! Don't skimp on it â€“ it's essential for infusing
          the pasta<br />
          with rich, nutty flavor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Red pepper flakes</h3>
        <p>
          For heat! If you're sensitive to spice, feel free to skip them, or
          start with<br />
          just 1/4 teaspoon. If you want your pasta to have more of a kick, add
          up to 1/2<br />
          teaspoon.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Parsley</h3>
        <p>Sprinkle it over the pasta for a lovely fresh finish.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Lemon</h3>
        <p>
          It may not be totally authentic, but if you ask me, a little lemon
          never hurt<br />
          anything. I use both lemon juice and zest to fill this pasta with
          bright flavor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Kale</h3>
        <p>
          If you ask me, pasta + greens are a match made in heaven. Feel free to
          skip the<br />
          kale if you prefer, or use different greens, such as spinach or Swiss
          chard, if<br />
          you don't have any kale on hand.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Parmesan cheese</h3>
        <p>
          Aglio e olio purists will tell you never to serve it with cheese, but
          I think a<br />
          shower of freshly grated Parmesan or vegan Parmesan is a welcome
          touch. Its nutty<br />
          taste pairs perfectly with the savory garlic.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        First, cook the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and
        cook the<br />
        pasta until al dente. Reserve some of the starchy pasta water before you
        drain it!
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, toast the garlic and red pepper flakes. Heat the oil in a large
        skillet<br />
        and add the garlic slices and red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic
        is<br />
        fragrant and lightly browned around the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, add the kale. Toss it with the garlic oil and cook until it wilts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, stir in the pasta, along with the lemon juice and zest and a
        splash of<br />
        the reserved pasta water. Toss to combine, adding more pasta water, as
        needed, to<br />
        create a light sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. That's it!
      </li>
    </ol>
