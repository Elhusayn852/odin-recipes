    <p>
      The first time I made this butternut squash pasta sauce, Jack couldn’t
      stop talking <br />about it for days. “That sauce!”, he kept saying. “That
      sauce!” Of course, I teased <br />him for it, but if I’m being totally
      honest, I was completely smitten with it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at this butternut squash pasta, you might expect it to taste like
      mac and <br />cheese. But don’t be fooled. The creamy sauce is rich and
      nutty, with bold autumn <br />flavor from herbs like sage and thyme.
      Because it’s so flavorful and complex, this <br />butternut squash pasta
      would make a show-stopping vegetarian main dish at a special
      <br />occasion dinner (pasta for Thanksgiving, anyone?). Still, it’s
      really comforting and <br />easy to make, so go ahead and enjoy it on
      regular old weeknights too. On cold nights, <br />Jack and I have been
      loading it into bowls and cozying up on the couch. One bowl is
      <br />plenty to warm us up, but it tastes so good that we always go back
      for seconds…or, in <br />Jack’s case, thirds.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Shallots and garlic</h3>
        <p>
          They roast along with the squash, becoming sweet, nutty, and tender.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cashews</h3>
        <p>My go-to ingredient for making sauces rich and creamy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Nutritional yeast</h3>
        <p>It adds umami flavor to this butternut squash pasta sauce.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Balsamic vinegar</h3>
        <p>For tang.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Sage and thyme</h3>
        <p>They add earthy autumn flavor to the creamy sauce.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Extra-virgin olive oil</h3>
        <p>For richness.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Sea salt and fresh black pepper</h3>
        <p>To make all the flavors pop!</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, roast the veggies. Drizzle the squash with olive oil and sprinkle
        it with salt and <br />pepper. Then, place it cut-side-down on a
        parchment-lined baking sheet. Wrap the <br />shallots and garlic in foil
        with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt, and add them to
        <br />the baking sheet too. Roast for 30 minutes at 425°F, or until the
        squash is tender.
      </li>

      <li>
        Then, blend the butternut squash sauce. Add 1 cup roasted butternut
        squash, the shallots, <br />peeled garlic cloves, cashews, nutritional
        yeast, vinegar, herbs, salt, and pepper to a <br />high-speed blender.
        Pour in some water and olive oil to get the blender moving, and blend to
        <br />form a thick, creamy sauce.
      </li>

      <li>
        Next, cook the pasta! Add it to a large pot of boiling water, and cook
        until al dente. Before <br />you drain the pasta, reserve 1 cup of the
        starchy pasta water.
      </li>

      <li>
        Finally, add the pasta back into the pot. Stir in the sauce, adding 1/2
        to 1 cup of the reserved <br />pasta water to loosen the sauce and coat
        the pasta. Season to taste with salt and pepper, <br />and enjoy!
      </li>
