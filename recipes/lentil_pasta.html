    <p>
      Ok, pasta lovers, you need this lentil pasta recipe in your winter
      rotation! It’s budget-friendly, <br />
      easy to make, and comforting in the way that only pasta with red sauce can
      be. Though this lentil <br />
      pasta recipe is full of Italian flavors (marinara! balsamic! Parmesan!),
      it’s not a take on any <br />
      specific Italian pasta dish. Rather, it’s something I love to cook when I
      want a hearty, flavorful <br />
      pasta dinner, but I don’t want to go to the store or spend hours in the
      kitchen. This lentil pasta <br />
      recipe comes together with basic pantry ingredients, and you can have it
      on the table in right <br />
      around 30 minutes. I think you’re going to love it!
    </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <p>Here’s what you’ll need to make this lentil pasta recipe:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Lentils</h3>
        <p>
          They pack this pasta with nutrients like fiber and <br />plant-based
          protein. I like to use French green lentils <br />because they retain
          a nice bite when cooked. Regular <br />green or brown lentils will
          work too, but avoid red <br />lentils, as they turn too soft.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Pasta</h3>
        <p>
          Pappardelle is my noodle of choice. Its wide, chewy <br />ribbons work
          well with the hearty lentil sauce. If you <br />can’t find it,
          tagliatelle is a great sub. For a vegan <br />option, use egg-free
          fettuccine or linguine. Gluten-free? <br />Use your favorite
          alternative!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Onion, carrots, and garlic</h3>
        <p>
          They create the flavorful base of the sauce, adding <br />rich depth
          to the dish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cremini mushrooms</h3>
        <p>
          They add a rich, savory complexity to the sauce, <br />enhancing its
          umami depth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Tamari and balsamic vinegar</h3>
        <p>
          They bring out the deep umami flavors in the <br />mushrooms, making
          the sauce even more robust.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Extra-virgin olive oil</h3>
        <p>
          Used for sautéing the veggies, enhancing their <br />flavors, and
          adding richness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Marinara sauce</h3>
        <p>
          Homemade or store-bought, it gives the dish its <br />classic, rich
          tomato flavor. I like making mine with <br />crushed tomatoes, dried
          oregano, garlic, and red <br />pepper flakes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Parmesan cheese</h3>
        <p>
          For topping the pasta, adding nutty, salty richness. <br />For a vegan
          option, use dairy-free Parmesan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Fresh parsley</h3>
        <p>
          Sprinkle it over the pasta for a fresh, vibrant <br />finish that
          brightens up the dish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Salt and pepper</h3>
        <p>
          Essential for making all the flavors pop and <br />bringing balance to
          the dish.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Use pre-made marinara. As much as I love to make my marinara sauce from
        scratch, <br />doing so adds a whole 30 minutes to this recipe… NOT what
        I want on a busy weeknight. <br />If I’m lucky, I’ll have some leftover
        marinara on hand in the freezer, but if I don’t, <br />I use
        store-bought here. Rao’s is my favorite brand. It makes this recipe
        super flavorful <br />and amazingly fast!
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep cooked lentils on hand in the freezer. They’ll come in handy not
        only for this <br />lentil pasta recipe, but for grain bowls and salads
        as well! If you don’t have cooked <br />lentils handy, start this recipe
        by cooking 1/2 cup dry lentils according to this <br />instructions in
        this post.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start by cooking the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water. When
        the pasta is <br />al dente, drain it and toss it with a little olive
        oil to prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, sauté the veggies. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over
        medium heat. Add <br />the onion and carrot and cook, stirring
        occasionally, until they soften, 5 to 8 minutes. <br />Then, add the
        mushrooms, garlic, salt, and pepper, and cook until the mushrooms are
        <br />tender, another 5 to 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the remaining sauce ingredients and simmer. Stir in the balsamic and
        tamari, <br />followed by the lentils and marinara. Cook, stirring,
        until the sauce is well combined <br />and heated through, 2 minutes or
        so.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, mix in the pasta. Add it to the skillet and toss to coat in the
        sauce. <br />Season to taste…
      </li>
    </ol>
